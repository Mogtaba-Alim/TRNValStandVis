\title{Dataset of the overall validation score of individual Transcription Factors.}
\format{
A dataframe with 2 columns:
\describe{
\item{TF}{Transcription Factor name in HGNC. }
\item{Ratio_to_Overall_Avg}{Normalized Average validation score for all TFs interactions.}

...
}
}
\usage{
data(TF_Avg_Valid)
}
\description{
This dataset maps every HGNC standardized TF to its overall avg validation score
over all it TF-TG interactions. Ratio_to_Overall_Avg is a qualitative value
that represents the normalized average validation quality of a specific TF
over all TF-TG interactions in the combined dataset that involved that TF.
